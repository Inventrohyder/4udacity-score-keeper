# Tong Il Mood Doo Score Counter
###### _Based on the udacity court counter android application_
This is the second project in the Android Basics Nanodegree

Part of the Android Basics: User Input course

The app keeps count of the scoring of two teams in a Martial Arts competition.
This are the rules of scoring in the game (simplified):
- An aerial kick earns 3 points
- A normal (grounded) kick earns 2 points.
- A punch earns 1 point.
- A penalty deducts 1 point.

Enjoy the app.
